    <h2>TRAIN STAFF</h2>
    <p>Train staff is a job related to the train, however this varies from checking tickets of the passengers to maintaining the train carriages and keeping them clean and tidy for journeys.
      They also help load and unload passengers' luggage onto and off the train and as well as helping the passengers safely get on and off the train.
      Lastly, they have to signal the engine staff to depart when all the luggage, passengers and staff have safely boarded the train. 
      This job requires attention to detail, focus and physical strength needed to help load and unload luggage as well as being able to communicate with and help passengers.
